## Features

- **Permission Management**  
  Robust handling of location permissions and service availability using `flutter_bloc`.
  
- **Interactive Mapping**  
  Smooth map interactions using [flutter_map](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map) along with [latlong2](https://pub.dev/packages/latlong2) and [flutter_map_animations](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_map_animations).

- **Animated Markers & Dynamic Paths**  
  Engaging marker animations with [Lottie](https://pub.dev/packages/lottie) and real-time polyline tracking of your movement.

- **MVVM Architecture**  
  Clean separation of UI and business logic following Flutter‚Äôs recommended MVVM structure.

- **Analysis Options**  
  Built-in options for tracking and analyzing your movement data.
